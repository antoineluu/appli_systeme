# Prepare
Python version: 3.9.9
Please update the value of ``SAR_AF_DATA_PATH`` in 'data.yaml' to your dataset path.
You should also 
Do pip ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

# Download


## Model
(``RealPE.tar.bz2``) on ALOS PALSAR dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aAIdmY-pYGH3PCuHVTf43Wh0Hcg7mzIb?usp=sharing). Put it here and uncompress it.
64CELMs model trained by the authors [doi](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13142683)
The models we trained is [32CELMs](/snapshot/BaggingECELMs/RealPE/2021/weights/32CELMs.pth.tar) and [8CELMs](/snapshot/BaggingECELMs/RealPE/2021/weights/8CELMs.pth.tar)
## Data:
